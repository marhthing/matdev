# System Architecture

## Core Architecture
The system follows a modular, object-oriented design with clear separation of concerns:

- **Main Bot Class (MATDEV)** - Central orchestrator that manages all components and maintains connection state
- **Connection Manager** - Handles WebSocket connections with intelligent reconnection strategies and backoff algorithms
- **Session Manager** - Manages WhatsApp authentication sessions with automatic QR code handling and pairing
- **Message Handler** - Processes incoming messages, routes commands, and applies middleware
- **Security Manager** - Implements anti-ban protection, rate limiting, and threat detection
- **Cache Manager** - Multi-tier caching system for optimal performance with separate stores for different data types

## Design Patterns
- **Singleton Pattern** - Each manager class is instantiated once and shared across the application
- **Plugin Architecture** - Modular command system allowing easy extension without core modifications
- **Middleware Pattern** - Message processing pipeline with configurable middleware chains
- **Observer Pattern** - Event-driven architecture for connection state changes and message handling

## Message Processing Pipeline
1. Raw message ingestion from Baileys WebSocket
2. Security filtering and rate limiting checks
3. Message info extraction and normalization
4. Middleware processing chain
5. Command routing and execution
6. Response generation and delivery

## Security Features
- **Rate Limiting** - Per-user message limits with sliding window algorithm
- **Anti-Ban Protection** - Intelligent message delays and burst control
- **Suspicious Activity Detection** - Pattern recognition for spam and abuse
- **Command Authorization** - Role-based access control with owner-only commands
- **Group LID Registration** - One-time registration system for WhatsApp Business accounts
- **LID Validation** - Validates WhatsApp Business LID format and prevents duplicate registrations

## Performance Optimizations
- **Multi-tier Caching** - Separate caches for messages, users, groups, and media with different TTL settings
- **Concurrent Processing** - Configurable message processing limits to prevent overload
- **Smart Media Handling** - Automatic compression and format conversion with size limits
- **Memory Management** - Periodic cleanup tasks and garbage collection optimization
